The color I choose is #A4A5F5 for background-color. For submit and clear button, color is #8E70CF.

When submit the input, the result will appear after submit button clicked. And alert message will appear if there are no input.
I also add-in code 
```javascript
result.style.color
```
to give different color for result.
